# Excel-project
This project is an end-to-end Sales Analysis Dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel for an online gifting brand. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into insights that help the business understand performance trends, customer purchasing behaviour, and product demand patterns across India.
The dashboard analyses 1,000 customer orders, covering multiple gift categories, seasonal occasions, and delivery regions. Using pivot tables, pivot charts, slicers, and calculated metrics, the report allows users to explore and filter data intuitively without requiring manual analysis.

⭐ Project Highlights

Total Orders

Average Order-to-Delivery Time
These KPIs update dynamically based on slicer selections, enabling real-time insight discovery.
